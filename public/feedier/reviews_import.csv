"Very bad housing association. They want your money and that‚Äôs all. They don‚Äôt care about problems or defects. They allowed to build houses with windows that let the draught passing through and it‚Äôs a waste of energy bills. The traffic noise is horrible as well. Very bad experience

"I have been in the flat for 2 years and the teams have been amazing. Supporting residents through COVID-19, addressing complaints and maintenance issues. The renewal team was very comprehensive of my situation. A big thank you üôè to Jemma Herring and to all the team.",5,2021/08/08,"Ferry Ln, London N17 9NF, United Kingdom",Windlass Apartments,Truspilot
"Was their tenant for nearly 5 years.
Not a single bad word to say.
Always very efficient and professional.
Would definitely recommend Grainger.",4,2021/08/01,"Kings Dock Mill, 7 Hurst St, Liverpool L1 8DA, UK",Kings Dock Mill Liverpool,Google
"Martin has been the onsite caretaker/building manager for the entire 5 years we lived in the building. He has been very helpful and quick to respond to any issues or problems that we had. Martin is a friendly face to see and chat with, has a good sense of humour, and is very hard working (as he has to oversee 3 buildings in the area). Since Grainger took over we had many positive interactions with Mark. He‚Äô has always been quick to respond to emails and was very helpful answering questions throughout our moving out period.",4,2021/07/22,"801 Silbury Blvd, Milton Keynes MK9 3FL, United Kingdom",Solstice Apartments,Truspilot
"They were just okay - very slow at replying to problems and the property itself was not cleaned before we moved in. They didn‚Äôt take anything off of our deposit and our property manager Louise was lovely

"Lift was broken for half of our tenancy. Seemed a long time to repair on multiple occasions.
No boxes for post meant some letters were lost.
Generally a quick response from grainger but not always and having to chase emails.
Martin was great and always very helpful.

"I bought a shared ownership new build with Grainger, have reported a number of issues and not had a response to any of the contact I have tried to make with them. Really disappointing.",2,2021/07/01,"Ferry Ln, London N17 9NF, United Kingdom",Windlass Apartments,Truspilot
